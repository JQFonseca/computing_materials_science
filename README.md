Jupyter notebooks for the Computing and Comunication 1st Year Materials Science Course at Manchester 

To use them, you need to install Python on your computer. I recommend using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). 

Alternatively, [Azure notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) are a pretty good way to run Python notebooks without installing Python.
